# Simplified RISC XL (Verilog)

This is a simplified RISC-style processor project implemented in Verilog as part of my Master's coursework at BTH.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `rtl/`: Contains core RTL modules like ALU, control unit, register file, and pipeline stages
- `tb/`: Testbenches for simulation
- `README.md`: Project overview
- `verilog_files.list`: Compilation file list (for tools like ModelSim or Synopsys VCS)

## âœ… Features
- Modular Verilog design (ALU, control unit, registers)
- Designed for ASIC methodology
- Basic ALU testbench provided
- Clean structure for learning or extension
